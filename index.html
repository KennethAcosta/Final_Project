            <h3>Fable Works' Creator</h3>
            <p> Hey there! Kenneth here! 
                Iâ€™m the creator of the website you are looking at, a college student in City Tech, in the Communication Design major. 
                I lived on the border between boroughs in New York for the entirety of my life. 
                Been someone who has delved into different mediums such as; watercoloring, sculpting, gouache painting, poetry, a bit of film, and a few others.
                All of them are outlets to spill out the ideas in my head, to make imagination manifest. 
                My two favorite mediums are traditional to digital, as seen mainly in my gallery. 
                Most of my inspirations come from mythos, religion, technology, biology, and so on. 
                These different things always fascinated me and the idea of fusing them to make a grand picture with contorted differences. 
                The biggest inspirations I had as a child, was mainly shows that contained different and unique creatures in fantasy world.
                Storys like that still intrest me to this day.

                <h3>w3-row and w3-container</h3>
                <p>While the <i>w3-row</i> class defines a padding-less container, when you also have 
                    <i>w3-container</i>, it adds 16-pixel padding around the entire row, but not between 
                    the contained elements, so you now see margins on each side of the page, but no gutters:</p>
                    <p>&lt;section class="w3-container w3-row"&gt;<br>
                    &lt;article class="w3-col s12 m4 l4"&gt;</p>
